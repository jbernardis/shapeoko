Low Hanging
	CNC/Shapeoko parameters - save to/load from alternate files, etc, set as default


Low Priority if at all

	Allow for tool changing mid cut - will need to reset z height - which will require some kind of referencing???
	
	basic design question - should tool be recorded in each object, or should it be the same throughout
