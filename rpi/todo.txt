show alarm information in status screen

icons - greyed when disabled

figure out why files dialog box won't center - figure out better control operations

do a better job of constructing and the parsing async messages - shouldn't have to add blank "data" field


Things to do to finalize:

remove "if shapeoko is None" tests in each panel
remove exit panel
remove show vs showfullscreen
